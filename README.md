# Team_Dynamic_Project
This is the team project public repo for Team Dynamic.

The dataset our group is working with is broadly the U.S Energy Information Administration Electricity dataset. More specific datasets, such as electricity generation per state will also be accessed for this project. 

This project is focusing on those who would be interested in United States energy production statistics, perhaps students or professionals in the energy field. Some of the specific questions that this project will answer include: what the electrical energy production of each state is, what the consumption level of resident's vs commercial uses per state, as well as the breakdown of fuel source for electricity production per state.
